# Home_Sales

For this week's challenge we were tasked with using our newly learned big data skills using PySpark and SparkSQL to determine some key metrics within provided data from the URL provided by EDX Bootcamp. The goal of this exercise was to answer key questions involving bedroom/bathroom count, square footage and the "view" metrics effects of the average sale price of these homes. It was also asked that we parquet our data table on a specific column as well as testing function run-times on both cached and non-cached tables to see if there is much of a difference in the overall run times. There was not much of a difference in the run-times; however, the provided dataset is not as large as those that are seen in the professional world.
